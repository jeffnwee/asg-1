Design Process

User Story 1

    As a user that is interested in BABYMONSTER, I want to be able to check out their new album, so that I will be able to listen to their new album as soon as possible.

    This website can help users to achieve this as the second section of the home page provides links to the group's albums, which are updated everytime the group releases a new album.

User Story 2

    As a user that is interested in BABYMONSTER, I want to be able to know their next concert dates, so that I can prepare to snatch tickets and plan my schedule to be able to attend the concert.

    This website can help users to achieve this as there is a concert page, which provides the dates and the countries of their next concert. This is updated everytime they have a new concert, thus allowing users to quickly achieve their goals.

User Story 3

    As a user that does not know much about BABYMONSTER, I want to be able to know more about them, so that I can gain understanding of their music and the artists.

    This website can help users to achieve this as there is an about page, which provides helpful information on the K-Pop group, allowing users to find out more about the group that they did not know about.

Testing

    1. Album Links
        i. At the home page, click on the "LISTEN  TO OUR ALBUM" button
       ii. Try to click on any album and it should open a new tab and bring you to their spotify album

    2. Concert Dates
        i. Go to the concert page
       ii. The details of their concert dates should be listed there

    3. About BABYMONSTER
        i. Go to the about page
       ii. Click on the next/previous button
      iii. It should navigate seamlessly to the next member's profile

    4. Issue Form
        i. Scroll down to the footer
       ii. Click on "Let us know!" button
      iii. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
       iv. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        v. Try to submit the form with an empty description and verify that a relevant error message appears
       vi. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

    On different screen sizes, most elements are responsive and should be viewed clearly on different sizes. On computers/laptops, the navigation bar is above the box while on mobile devices, the navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page.

    When testing, the error message would appear indefinitely if user press the submit button over and over again. For the members' profiles, the other members did not show up as I put 'overflow: hidden;' under the wrong section.
